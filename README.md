## Description

Turn your wearable device into an easy health journal!

## Problem We Are Solving

There is no easy way to view my health data.

## Target Users

Quantified self powerusers, anyone with a wearable who's interested in tracking his or her health, and medical service providers (i.e. doctors, trainers, family members).

## Three Things PowerNote Does Well 

* Makes it easy to check your status at a glance.
* Makes it easy to keep a journal and view your historical data.
* Makes it easy to share your data.

## How Does the Service Work?

1. Connect a wearable device with our service.
2. Write a journal entry.
3. Your journal entry will display health status data from the wearable device.
4. View and share the journal.
