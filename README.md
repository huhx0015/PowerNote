Turn your wearable device into an easy health journal!

1. Problem we are solving: There is no easy way to view my health data.

2. Target users: Quantified self powerusers, anyone with a wearable who's interested in tracking his or her health, and medical service providers (i.e. doctors, trainers, family members)

3. Three things PowerNote does well. - Makes it easy to check your status at a glance - Makes it easy to keep a journal and view your historical data - Makes it easy to share your data.

4. How does the service work? 1. Connect a wearable device with our service 2. Write a journal entry. 3. Your journal entry will display health status data from the wearable device. 4. View and share the journal.
